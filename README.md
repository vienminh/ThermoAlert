# ThermoAlert
Using the Particle Photon to R/W and interact with iOS application.

This is a small personal project using different ressources on the web 
(udemy with Chris Price, Youtube, Particle Website, Cocoa) to learn how to make an iOS application that
will interact with a Particle Photon chip (https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/photon-wifi-dev-kit).

Where I live, electricity rate is based on the outside temperature: when under -12 degC, I pay a higher rate, 
otherwise, I pay a really cheap rate.  I have a small device that consist of a LED hooked to thermostat system that illuminate when
under -12 degC.

This project will mainly read the input sent to that DEL throught the Photon and send the status to the app.

Skills to develop:
- Learn Particle Photon environment, SDK
- Learn Swift, Cocoa
